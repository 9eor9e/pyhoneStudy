# 关于for循环遍历list时的错误演示

#语法错误-循环语句没有缩进
# magicians = ['alice','mary','helan']
# for magician in magicians:
#     print(magician + ',thanks for your trick!')
# print("I can't wait to see your next trick," + magician.title() + '\n') # 这句原来应该缩进的，忘记缩进虽然编辑器没有报警，但这属于逻辑错误。
# print("Thank you,everyone.That was a great magic show!")
